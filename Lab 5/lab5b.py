# 5B. Re-write lab 6A but instead of searching for a personâ€™s name, 
# search for their birthday.  If the person is found, reprint their 
# entire record to the console.  The program should allow the user 
# to search for as many birthdays as they want. The program should 
# also print a statement telling the user how many iterations of the
# search loop the program went through before finding (or not finding) 
# the requested person.
# Extra Credit +10 points: print the user the found person, their data,
# along with their current age. 
#
#   VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
#       fname           The list for the first name field
#       lname           The list for the last name field
#       dob             The list for the date of birth field
#       answer          The user's answer to whether they want to perform another search
#       found           The flag variable for when an item is found in the sequential search
#       sn              The number of searches performed in a single search
#       item            The item the user is searching for
