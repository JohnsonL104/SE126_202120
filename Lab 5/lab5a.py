# Write a Python program that reads the data from the file and stores 
# all data into appropriate lists. The program should then prompt the 
# user for the personâ€™s last name they are searching for and display 
# all available information on that person if they are found.  You must
# use the sequential search.  The program should allow the user to 
# search for as many people as they want. The program should also print
# a statement telling the user how many iterations of the search loop
# the program went through before finding (or not finding) the requested
# person.
#
#   VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
#       fname           The list for the first name field
#       lname           The list for the last name field
#       dob             The list for the date of birth field
#       answer          The user's answer to whether they want to perform another search
#       found           The flag variable for when an item is found in the sequential search
#       sn              The number of searches performed in a single search
#       item            The item the user is searching for
