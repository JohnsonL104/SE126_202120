# Write a Python program that reads the data from the file and stores all data into appropriate lists.
# The program should then prompt the user for the personâ€™s last name they are searching for and display
# all available information on that person if they are found.  You must use the binary search method.
# The program should allow the user to search for as many people as they want. The program should also
# print a statement telling the user how many iterations of the search loop the program went through
# before finding (or not finding) the requested person.
#
#   VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
#       lname       The list for the last name field
#       fname       The list for the first name field
#       dob         The list for the date of birth field
#       item        The item the user is searching for
#       searchCount The ammount of times the program searches for the item
#       answer      The user's answer for wheather they want search for another item
